## 1st Project Choice
### Topic: Examining AI-enabled health misinformation: the case of COVID-19
### Project Type: Research-oriented; exploratory
### Problem Summary: Understand the differences of characteristics between AI-enabled vs. human-created misinformation 
### Proposed Solution
### Potential Blockers (provide mitigation ideas if possible)


## 2nd Project Choice
### Topic: Tools for addressing health misinformation: the case of COVID-19
### Project Type: Research-oriented; exploratory
### Problem Summary: Design prototypes of toolskits/ browser extensions/ or other tools that help address health misinformation issues. Health misinformation (i.e., false or misleading information about diseases, illnesses, potential treatments and cures, vaccines, diets and cosmetic procedures) can lead people to make decisions that could have harmful consequences for people's wellbeing. Health misinformation also spreads acorss communities, friends, and families easily and quickly. As such, it is crucial to help address the issues of misinformation. 
### Proposed Solution
### Potential Blockers (provide mitigation ideas if possible)


## 3rd Project Choice
### Topic: Dermatology Risk App
### Project Type: Application (pre-defined list)
### Problem Summary: Create an application that can use image recognition to potentially diagnosis any risk of skin issues. Cancer is a major treat in the health of people. Skin cancer is a hard task to detect. In recent years, there has been increased efforts to implement computer vision approaches in this field.  
### Proposed Solution: The increased global use of smartphones along with other technologies together with deep learning and machine learning methods have intended to provide a supplementary mobile assisted skin disease diagnostic. This app would track any potential moles that would be at risk for cancer. It should track locations on the body, along with sites of interest with tracking based on timing of images. A possible technique for the skin cancer detection and image classification could be to implement convolutional neural networks.
### Potential Blockers (provide mitigation ideas if possible): The issue could be the access to the images, but also the dimensions of the images that could affect the interpretation of the app.
